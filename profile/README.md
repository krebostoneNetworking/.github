KreboNetworkFramework and its plugins' mission is to help everyone to have a bootstrap for their website development. Everyone can either direcly uses the out-of-the-box handler methods or APIs to build their services!

We are currently working on the following projects / plugins:

- KreboUser - Plugin for easy and basic user management
- KreboStorage - Plugin for easy and basic online file storage and management
